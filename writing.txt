In my first year of college life, I encountered a challenge of running a program on the MacOS instead of the Windows which is much familiar.
Stepping out of the comfort zone, I decided to embark on an introductory coding course.
Beyond the technic skills, the coding journey also enhanced my resilience and adaptability.
I grasp embracing the failure as an essential part of the learning process, each setback becoming an opportunity for improvement and critical thinking.
The symphony of programming languages has witnessed my growth from a newbie to an adept coder.
